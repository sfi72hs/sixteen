One of the things that SFI does best is to bring diverse people into an intimate setting, where the outcome is often a surprisingly fluid and quick generation of ideas that are both novel and powerful.  Our basic premise for the 72-Hours of Science is to test the limits of this strategy, both in terms of pace and multidisciplinarity: is it possible to go from a novel research question to a publication in 72 hours while involving scientists spanning all of the major disciplines? More specifically, can the postdocs of SFI see a project from conception to publication in an almost unreasonable amount of time? Will the outcome be important/useful science? What do we learn along the way in terms of what works and doesn’t? What are the outcomes following such an event?



Our inspiration is the 48-hour film festival, where fairly impressive films are made in a short span of time. The outcome of our 72-hours is a test of “hyper-science” with the added benefits of at least: 1.) a wealth of new ideas and possible collaborations 2.) a closely knit group of postdocs 3.) a lot of fun 4.) the ability to assess how to improve such a process in the future, whether to replicate it, or how to design a better process (e.g. longer time, different group dynamics, etc.).
